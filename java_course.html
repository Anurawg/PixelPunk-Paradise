      <h2>Introduction to Java</h2>
      <p>
        Java is a versatile, object-oriented programming language known for its platform independence. Developed by Sun Microsystems (now owned by Oracle), Java provides a robust framework for building various applications.
      </p>
      <p>
        Java, developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems (acquired by Oracle Corporation), is a powerful and versatile programming language widely used for various applications, from web development to mobile apps and enterprise systems.
      </p>
      <p>
        One of Java's key features is its platform independence. Java code is compiled into bytecode, which can run on any device or operating system with the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) installed. This "write once, run anywhere" capability makes Java highly portable.
      </p>
      <p>
        Java is an object-oriented language, emphasizing concepts like classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation. These features enable developers to create modular, maintainable, and scalable applications by organizing code into reusable components.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another notable aspect of Java is its robust standard library. Java offers a vast collection of pre-built classes and methods, known as the Java API (Application Programming Interface), providing solutions for various programming tasks without needing to build functionality from scratch.
      </p>
      <p>
        Java's memory management is automatic, thanks to its garbage collection mechanism. This feature helps in deallocating memory occupied by objects that are no longer in use, reducing memory leaks and enhancing overall application stability.
      </p>
      <p>
        Moreover, Java's popularity stems from its extensive community support, rich documentation, and active developer ecosystem. The language continues to evolve with updates and new features, ensuring its relevance in the ever-changing landscape of technology.
      </p>
      <p>
        As you delve into the realm of Java programming, you embark on a journey to create robust and portable applications, leveraging its powerful features, extensive libraries, and strong community support.

    <section id="variables">
      <h2>Variables and Data Types</h2>
      <p>
        Java supports various data types such as integers, floating-point numbers, characters, booleans, and more. Understanding these types and their usage is fundamental in Java programming.
      </p>
      <p>
        In Java, variables are containers for storing data values. They are essential for temporarily holding and manipulating data within a program. Before using a variable in Java, you must declare its data type and name.
      </p>
      <h2>Variable Declaration and Initialization</h2>
      <p>
        Java supports various data types, such as integers, floating-point numbers, characters, booleans, and more. You can declare and initialize variables as follows:
      </p>
      <pre><code>
        // Integer variable
        int age = 25;
  
        // Floating-point variable
        double pi = 3.14;
  
        // Character variable
        char grade = 'A';
  
        // Boolean variable
        boolean isStudent = true;
      </code></pre>
      <p>
        Variable declaration in Java involves specifying the data type followed by the variable name. Initializing a variable means assigning a value to it during declaration.
      </p>
      <h2>Variable Scope</h2>
      <p>
        Java variables have scope, defining where they can be accessed within a program. Variables can have local scope, confined to a specific method or block, or class scope, making them accessible throughout the class.
      </p>
      <h2>Constants</h2>
      <p>
        Java allows defining constants using the 'final' keyword. Once assigned, the value of a constant cannot be changed during program execution. For example:
      </p>
      <pre><code>
        final int MAX_VALUE = 100;
      </code></pre>
      <p>
        'MAX_VALUE' is a constant variable with a fixed value of '100'. Any attempt to modify this variable will result in a compilation error.
      </p>
      <h2>Default Values</h2>
      <p>
        Java assigns default values to variables if they are not explicitly initialized. For instance, numeric variables default to '0', booleans default to 'false', and object references default to 'null'.
      </p>
      <h2>Variable Naming Conventions</h2>
      <p>
        Java follows naming conventions for variables, recommending meaningful names that adhere to camelCase. Variable names should start with a letter, underscore, or dollar sign and can include letters, digits, underscores, or dollar signs.
      </p>
      <p>
        Understanding variable types, their scope, and naming conventions is crucial in Java programming. Proper utilization of variables allows developers to efficiently store and manipulate data within their programs.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="control-flow">
      <h2>Control Flow and Loops</h2>
      <p>
        Control structures like 'if', 'else if', 'else', 'switch', 'for', 'while', etc., allow conditional execution and looping in Java, providing flexibility in program flow.
      </p>
      <p>
        Control flow in Java refers to the order in which statements are executed in a program. Java provides various control flow mechanisms such as conditional statements, loops, and branching, enabling developers to create flexible and efficient programs.
      </p>
      <h2>Conditional Statements</h2>
      <p>
        Conditional statements allow executing specific blocks of code based on certain conditions. Java supports 'if', 'else if', 'else', and the 'switch' statements.
      </p>
      <h3>'if', 'else if', and 'else' Statements</h3>
      <p>
        The 'if' statement checks a condition and executes a block of code if the condition is true. 'else if' provides an alternative condition to check, while 'else' captures anything that doesn't match the previous conditions. For example:
      </p>
      <pre><code>
        int num = 10;
  
        if (num > 0) {
            System.out.println("Number is positive");
        } else if (num == 0) {
            System.out.println("Number is zero");
        } else {
            System.out.println("Number is negative");
        }
      </code></pre>
      <h3>'switch' Statement</h3>
      <p>
        The 'switch' statement evaluates an expression and executes the block of code corresponding to the matched 'case'. It's useful for handling multiple conditions based on the value of an expression. For example:
      </p>
      <pre><code>
        int choice = 2;
  
        switch (choice) {
            case 1:
                System.out.println("Option 1 selected");
                break;
            case 2:
                System.out.println("Option 2 selected");
                break;
            case 3:
                System.out.println("Option 3 selected");
                break;
            default:
                System.out.println("Invalid choice");
        }
      </code></pre>
      <h2>Loops</h2>
      <p>
        Loops allow repetitive execution of a block of code. Java supports 'for', 'while', and 'do-while' loops.
      </p>
      <h3>'for' Loop</h3>
      <p>
        The 'for' loop initializes a variable, checks a condition, and updates the variable in each iteration. For example:
      </p>
      <pre><code>
        for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
            System.out.print(i + " ");
        }
      </code></pre>
      <h3>'while' Loop</h3>
      <p>
        The 'while' loop executes a block of code as long as the condition remains true. For example:
      </p>
      <pre><code>
        int j = 0;
        while (j < 5) {
            System.out.print(j + " ");
            j++;
        }
      </code></pre>
      <h3>'do-while' Loop</h3>
      <p>
        The 'do-while' loop is similar to the 'while' loop but ensures that the block of code is executed at least once before checking the condition. For example:
      </p>
      <pre><code>
        int k = 0;
        do {
            System.out.print(k + " ");
            k++;
        } while (k < 5);
      </code></pre>
      <h2>Break and Continue Statements</h2>
      <p>
        Java provides 'break' and 'continue' statements to control loop execution. 'break' terminates the loop, while 'continue' skips the current iteration and continues with the next iteration.
      </p>
      <h2>Branching with 'return' Statement</h2>
      <p>
        In methods, the 'return' statement immediately exits the method and can also return a value. For example:
      </p>
      <pre><code>
        public int checkNumber(int number) {
            if (number > 0) {
                return 1;
            } else if (number < 0) {
                return -1;
            } else {
                return 0;
            }
        }
      </code></pre>
      <p>
        Control flow structures in Java are fundamental for creating logic-driven programs. Understanding and utilizing these mechanisms allow developers to efficiently manage program flow and execute code based on specific conditions or iterations.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="functions">
      <h2>Functions and Methods</h2>
      <p>
        Functions in Java, referred to as methods, are reusable blocks of code that perform specific tasks. They enable developers to organize code and facilitate reusability.
      </p>
      <p>
        Functions, also known as methods in Java, are blocks of code that perform specific tasks and can be called or invoked when needed. They aid in code organization, reusability, and modularity within a program.
      </p>
      <h2>Function Declaration and Definition</h2>
      <p>
        To declare and define a function in Java, you specify the access modifier (like 'public' or 'private'), return type, function name, and parameters (if any). For example:
      </p>
      <pre><code>
        public int add(int a, int b) {
            return a + b;
        }
      </code></pre>
      <p>
        Here, 'add' is a public method that takes two integer parameters ('a' and 'b') and returns their sum.
      </p>
      <h2>Function Calling</h2>
      <p>
        Functions are called or invoked by their names, passing required arguments. For example:
      </p>
      <pre><code>
        int result = add(5, 3); // Calling the 'add' method
        System.out.println("Sum is: " + result);
      </code></pre>
      <p>
        The 'add' method is called with arguments '5' and '3', and its return value is stored in the 'result' variable.
      </p>
      <h2>Method Parameters</h2>
      <p>
        Methods in Java can have parameters, which act as placeholders for data to be passed into the function. Parameters are specified within parentheses in the method definition. For instance:
      </p>
      <pre><code>
        public void displayMessage(String message) {
            System.out.println(message);
        }
      </code></pre>
      <p>
        Here, 'displayMessage' is a method that takes a 'String' parameter 'message' and displays it.
      </p>
      <h2>Return Values</h2>
      <p>
        Methods in Java can return values using the 'return' statement. The return type in the method declaration specifies the type of value returned by the method. For example:
      </p>
      <pre><code>
        public int multiply(int x, int y) {
            return x * y;
        }
      </code></pre>
      <p>
        The 'multiply' method takes two integer parameters and returns their product.
      </p>
      <h2>Void Methods</h2>
      <p>
        Some methods in Java do not return any value; they are referred to as 'void' methods. They perform an operation without returning a value. For example:
      </p>
      <pre><code>
        public void greet(String name) {
            System.out.println("Hello, " + name + "!");
        }
      </code></pre>
      <p>
        'greet' is a 'void' method that takes a 'String' parameter 'name' and displays a greeting message.
      </p>
      <h2>Method Overloading</h2>
      <p>
        Java supports method overloading, allowing multiple methods with the same name but different parameter lists. This feature enhances code readability and flexibility. For example:
      </p>
      <pre><code>
        public void display(int value) {
            System.out.println("Value: " + value);
        }
  
        public void display(double value) {
            System.out.println("Value: " + value);
        }
      </code></pre>
      <p>
        'display' methods demonstrate overloading with different parameter types ('int' and 'double').
      </p>
      <p>
        Functions, or methods, are integral to Java programming, providing a structured way to organize code, enable reusability, and encapsulate functionality. Understanding their various features like parameters, return values, void methods, and method overloading is crucial for building efficient and modular Java applications.
