      <h2>Introduction to C++</h2>
      <p>
        C++ is a powerful, high-performance programming language derived from C. It combines imperative, object-oriented, and generic programming features, making it versatile for various applications.
      </p>
      <p>
        C++, developed by Bjarne Stroustrup in 1979 at Bell Laboratories, is an extension of the C programming language. It retains C's efficiency and provides high-level constructs for object-oriented programming (OOP), making it suitable for developing a wide range of applications, from system software to graphical applications and more.
      </p>
      <p>
        C++ inherits many features from C, including its syntax, data types, and control structures. However, it introduces additional functionalities like classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, templates, and more, making it a versatile and powerful programming language.
      </p>
      <p>
        One of the key features of C++ is its support for OOP paradigms. Classes and objects enable developers to model real-world entities, allowing for better code organization and reusability. Inheritance and polymorphism further enhance the flexibility and extensibility of code by facilitating the creation of hierarchies and enabling dynamic behavior.
      </p>
      <p>
        Memory management in C++ is another notable aspect. While it offers the convenience of high-level abstractions, it also provides control over memory allocation and deallocation through pointers, giving developers the ability to work at a lower level when necessary.
      </p>
      <p>
        C++ is renowned for its performance and flexibility. Its extensive standard library provides numerous pre-defined functions and data types, facilitating rapid development. Additionally, it supports both procedural and object-oriented programming paradigms, allowing developers to choose the best approach for their projects.
      </p>
      <p>
        As you explore the world of C++ programming, you'll discover a language that empowers you to build efficient, robust, and scalable applications. Its combination of low-level control and high-level abstractions makes it a powerful tool for software development across various domains.

      <h2>Variables and Data Types</h2>
      <p>
        C++ supports various data types, including integers, floating-point numbers, characters, arrays, and more. Understanding these types and their usage is fundamental in C++ programming.
      </p>
      <p>
        In C++, variables are used to store data values. They act as named containers that hold information. Before using a variable in C++, you need to declare its type and name.
      </p>
      <p>
        C++ supports various data types, such as integers, floating-point numbers, characters, booleans, arrays, and more. For example:
      </p>
      <pre><code>
        int num = 10;  // Integer
        float pi = 3.14;  // Floating-point number
        char letter = 'A';  // Character
        bool isTrue = true;  // Boolean
      </code></pre>
      <p>
        Variable declaration in C++ involves specifying the data type followed by the variable name. You can initialize a variable upon declaration by assigning a value to it.
      </p>
      <p>
        C++ allows constant variables using the 'const' keyword. Once defined, the value of a constant variable cannot be changed. For instance:
      </p>
      <pre><code>
        const int MAX_VALUE = 100;
      </code></pre>
      <p>
        C++ also supports variable scope, defining where a variable can be accessed. Variables can have global scope, accessible throughout the program, or local scope, confined within a specific block or function.
      </p>
      <p>
        Additionally, C++ provides the concept of pointers, which store memory addresses. Pointers allow direct manipulation of memory and are used for dynamic memory allocation. For example:
      </p>
      <pre><code>
        int* ptr;  // Pointer declaration
        int value = 5;
        ptr = &value;  // Assigning address of 'value' to pointer 'ptr'
      </code></pre>
      <p>
        Understanding variable types, their scope, and memory management is crucial in C++ programming. Proper utilization of variables allows developers to efficiently store and manipulate data within their programs.

      <h2>Control Flow and Loops</h2>
      <p>
        Control structures like 'if', 'else', 'switch', 'for', 'while', etc., allow conditional execution and looping in C++, providing flexibility in program flow.
      </p>
      <p>
        Control flow in C++ refers to the order in which statements are executed in a program. C++ provides various control flow mechanisms like conditional statements and loops, enabling developers to create flexible and efficient programs.
      </p>
      <h2>Conditional Statements</h2>
      <p>
        Conditional statements, primarily 'if', 'else if' (or 'elif'), and 'else', allow the execution of specific code blocks based on certain conditions. For instance:
      </p>
      <pre><code>
        int num = 10;
  
        if (num > 0) {
            std::cout << "Number is positive";
        } else if (num == 0) {
            std::cout << "Number is zero";
        } else {
            std::cout << "Number is negative";
        }
      </code></pre>
      <p>
        The 'if' statement checks a condition and executes the block of code if the condition is true. 'else if' provides an alternative condition to check, while 'else' captures anything that doesn't match the previous conditions.
      </p>
      <h2>Switch Statement</h2>
      <p>
        C++ also includes the 'switch' statement, useful for handling multiple conditions based on the value of an expression. It's often used when multiple 'if' conditions are needed. For example:
      </p>
      <pre><code>
        int choice = 2;
  
        switch (choice) {
            case 1:
                std::cout << "Option 1 selected";
                break;
            case 2:
                std::cout << "Option 2 selected";
                break;
            case 3:
                std::cout << "Option 3 selected";
                break;
            default:
                std::cout << "Invalid choice";
        }
      </code></pre>
      <p>
        The 'switch' statement evaluates the 'choice' variable and executes the block of code corresponding to the matched 'case'. The 'break' statement terminates the 'switch' block.
      </p>
      <h2>Loops</h2>
      <p>
        Loops in C++ allow repetitive execution of a block of code. The 'for', 'while', and 'do-while' loops are commonly used. For example:
      </p>
      <pre><code>
        // For loop
        for (int i = 0; i < 5; ++i) {
            std::cout << i << " ";
        }
  
        // While loop
        int j = 0;
        while (j < 5) {
            std::cout << j << " ";
            j++;
        }
  
        // Do-while loop
        int k = 0;
        do {
            std::cout << k << " ";
            k++;
        } while (k < 5);
      </code></pre>
      <p>
        The 'for' loop initializes a variable, checks a condition, and updates the variable in each iteration. The 'while' loop executes a block of code as long as the condition remains true. The 'do-while' loop is similar but executes the block at least once before checking the condition.
      </p>
      <p>
        Control flow structures in C++ are fundamental for creating logic-driven programs. Understanding and utilizing these mechanisms allow developers to efficiently manage program flow and execute code based on specific conditions or iterations.
      </p>

        } else {
            std::cout << "Number is negative";
        }

            case 2:
                std::cout << "Option 2 selected";
                break;
            case 3:
                std::cout << "Option 3 selected";
                break;
            default:
                std::cout << "Invalid choice";
        }
      </code></pre>

        int j = 0;
        while (j < 5) {
            std::cout << j << " ";
            j++;
        }
  
        // Do-while loop
        int k = 0;
        do {
            std::cout << k << " ";
