      <h2>Variables and Data Types</h2>
      <p>
        Python uses dynamic typing, enabling variables to automatically change types based on the assigned value. Common data types include integers, floats, strings, lists, tuples, dictionaries, and more. Understanding these data types and their usage is fundamental in Python programming.
      </p>
      <p>
        Variables in Python serve as containers to store data values. Python employs dynamic typing, allowing variables to be assigned values without explicitly declaring their data types.
      </p>
      <p>
        Python supports various data types: integers, floats, strings, lists, tuples, dictionaries, etc. For instance:
      </p>
      <pre><code>
        num = 10  # Integer
        pi = 3.14  # Float
        name = "John"  # String
        my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4]  # List
        my_tuple = (5, 6, 7)  # Tuple
        my_dict = {'a': 1, 'b': 2}  # Dictionary
      </code></pre>
      <p>
        Variables are declared by assigning values using the assignment operator (=). Python infers the data type based on the assigned value.
      </p>
      <p>
        Variable names in Python should be descriptive, following certain conventions. They can include letters, numbers, and underscores but cannot start with a number.
      </p>
      <p>
        Python uses different scopes for variables. Global variables are accessible throughout the program, while local variables are confined to the scope they are defined in. For example:
      </p>
      <pre><code>
        global_var = 20  # Global variable
  
        def my_function():
            local_var = 30  # Local variable
            print(global_var)  # Access global variable
            print(local_var)  # Access local variable
  
        my_function()
      </code></pre>
      <p>
        Python provides the <code>id()</code> function to retrieve the memory address of a variable:
      </p>
      <pre><code>
        x = 10
        print(id(x))  # Memory address of x
      </code></pre>
      <p>
        Python's dynamic typing simplifies programming by allowing flexibility in variable assignment and usage. Understanding data types and their characteristics is crucial for leveraging Python effectively. Variables are foundational to writing efficient and concise Python code.
      </p>

    <section id="control-flow">
      <h2>Control Flow and Loops</h2>
      <p>
        Similar to C, Python offers control structures like <code>if</code>, <code>else</code>, <code>elif</code>, <code>for</code>, and <code>while</code> for decision-making and looping. Python's syntax emphasizes indentation, enhancing code readability and structure.
      </p>
      <p>
        Control flow structures in Python determine the order in which statements are executed. Python offers various control structures, including conditional statements ('if', 'elif', 'else') and loops ('for' and 'while'), enabling developers to create efficient and flexible programs.
      </p>
      <p>
        The 'if' statement is used for decision-making based on conditions. For example:
      </p>
      <pre><code>
        num = 10
  
        if num > 0:
            print("Number is positive")
        elif num == 0:
            print("Number is zero")
        else:
            print("Number is negative")
      </code></pre>
      <p>
        The 'if' statement checks if a condition is true and executes the block of code inside it. 'elif' and 'else' are optional and used for additional conditions and an alternative block of code, respectively.
      </p>
      <p>
        Python's 'for' loop is used for iterating over sequences like lists, tuples, strings, etc. Here's an example:
      </p>
      <pre><code>
        my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
  
        for num in my_list:
            print(num)
      </code></pre>
      <p>
        The 'for' loop iterates through each element in the list and performs the specified actions. It's valuable for executing a block of code multiple times, iterating over collections, and performing repetitive tasks.
      </p>
      <p>
        Python's 'while' loop executes a block of code as long as a specified condition is true. For example:
      </p>
      <pre><code>
        num = 5
  
        while num > 0:
            print(num)
            num -= 1
      </code></pre>
      <p>
        The 'while' loop repeatedly executes the block of code as long as the condition remains true. It's suitable for scenarios where the number of iterations is not known beforehand.
      </p>
      <p>
        Control flow structures in Python offer flexibility in decision-making and looping, allowing developers to create logic-driven programs. Proper understanding and utilization of these structures enhance code readability, maintainability, and efficiency.

    <section id="functions">
      <h2>Functions and Modules</h2>
      <p>
        Functions in Python are defined using the <code>def</code> keyword. Python's modular design encourages function reuse and allows code organization into modules and packages, facilitating better code management and reusability.
      </p>
      <p>
        Functions in Python are reusable blocks of code that perform specific tasks. They allow developers to break down programs into smaller, manageable parts, promoting code reusability and modularity.
      </p>
      <p>
        Defining a function in Python involves using the 'def' keyword followed by the function name and parentheses containing optional parameters. For example:
      </p>
      <pre><code>
        def greet():
            print("Hello, welcome to Python!")
      </code></pre>
      <p>
        Functions can take parameters that act as placeholders for data to be passed into the function. For instance:
      </p>
      <pre><code>
        def greet_user(name):
            print(f"Hello, {name}! Welcome.")
      </code></pre>
      <p>
        Functions can return values using the 'return' statement. For example:
      </p>
      <pre><code>
        def add_numbers(a, b):
            return a + b
      </code></pre>
      <p>
        Python allows default parameter values in functions. If a parameter is not provided, it takes the default value specified in the function definition. For instance:
      </p>
      <pre><code>
        def greet_user(name="Guest"):
            print(f"Hello, {name}! Welcome.")
      </code></pre>
      <p>
        Functions can also accept an arbitrary number of arguments using the '*' operator. These arguments are treated as tuples within the function. For example:
      </p>
      <pre><code>
        def sum_values(*args):
            total = 0
            for num in args:
                total += num
            return total
      </code></pre>
      <p>
        Python supports keyword arguments, where arguments are passed as key-value pairs. This allows flexibility and readability when calling functions. For instance:
      </p>
      <pre><code>
        def greet_person(name, age):
            print(f"Hello, {name}! You are {age} years old.")
  
        greet_person(age=25, name="Alice")
      </code></pre>
      <p>
        Functions in Python promote code organization, reusability, and readability. They serve as building blocks for programs, allowing developers to encapsulate logic into modular units for better maintenance and scalability.
